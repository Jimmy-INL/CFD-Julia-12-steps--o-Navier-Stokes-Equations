##Welcome to CFD Julia

Hello! Welcome to the **12 steps to Navier-Stokes**. This is a practical module that is used in the beginning of an interactive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) course taught by [Prof. Lorena Barba](lorenabarba.com) between 2009 and 2013 at Boston University (Prof. Barba since moved to the George Washington University). The course assumes only basic programming knowledge (in any language) and of course some foundation in partial differential equations and fluid mechanics. The practical module was inspired by the ideas of Dr. Rio Yokota, who was a post-doc in Prof. Barba's lab, and has been refined by Prof. Barba and her students over several semesters teaching the course. The course is taught entirely using Python and students who don't know Python just learn as we work through the module.
